# Enterprise Review Website Component

This directory contains a simple front-end web application for reviewing enterprises.

## Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website layout and content.
*   `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the website.
*   `script.js`: Contains client-side JavaScript for interactivity (currently basic).

## How to Use

1.  Ensure you have all three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) in the same directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

## Current Features

*   Static display of sample enterprises and reviews.
*   A form to submit new reviews. (Note: Form submission currently only logs to the browser console and shows an alert. No data is saved persistently.)

## Future Development

This is a very basic implementation. Potential future enhancements include:
*   Connecting to a backend database to store and retrieve enterprise and review data.
*   Implementing user authentication.
*   Adding more dynamic features for searching, sorting, and filtering enterprises.
*   Improving UI/UX.
